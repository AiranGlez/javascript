## THE ROLE OF JAVASCRIPT IN WEB APPLICATIONS

### Web Browsers and Web Servers

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems that allows users to communicate data on the World Wide Web. As a request-response protocol, HTTP gives users a way to interact with web resources such as HTML files by transmitting hypertext messages between clients and servers. HTTP clients generally use Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connections to communicate with servers.

So, whenever you make a request for a web page or any other resource on the Internet, you typically get a bundle of resources in the HTTP response. These includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Images and Videos. In this interaction, the role of web browsers is to formulate the HTTP request and also pass the HTTP response. The role of the web server is to receive HTTP requests for resources and they have the ability to figure out where exactly those resources are serve them to the one making the request. Any modern web browser has the ability to interpret HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

### HTML, CSS & JavaScript

- HTML: Hypertext Markup Language, a standardized system for tagging text files to achieve font, colour, graphic, and hyperlink effects on World Wide Web pages.

- CSS: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.

- JavaScript: JavaScript is a client-side programming language commonly used in web development. The source code is processed by the client's web browser rather than on the web server, and it is just-in-time compiled and executed by the browser. JavaScript code can be inserted anywhere within the HTML of a webpage. The purpose of JavaScript is to control the behaviour of the web page.

TIP: JavaScript client apps should be kept simple. Complex operations should be done on the server.

### The Document Object Model (DOM)

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming API for HTML and XML documents. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated. In the DOM specification, the term "document" is used in the broad sense - increasingly, XML is being used as a way of representing many different kinds of information that may be stored in diverse systems, and much of this would traditionally be seen as data rather than as documents. Nevertheless, XML presents this data as documents, and the DOM may be used to manage this data.

With the Document Object Model, programmers can create and build documents, navigate their structure, and add, modify, or delete elements and content. Anything found in an HTML or XML document can be accessed, changed, deleted, or added using the Document Object Model, with a few exceptions - in particular, the DOM interfaces for the internal subset and external subset have not yet been specified.

## FUNDAMENTALS OF JAVASCRIPT

### JavaScript Features

- Variables

- Functions

- Looping && control structures

- Arrays

- Objects

- Input/Output

### Functions and variables

Functions and variables are created when the page is loaded. They are destroyed when a new page is loaded in the browser. They will not persist across multiple pages in your browser session unless you explicity make provisions to handle that.

Scope:

- Global: are accesible as long as a particular JavaScript source file is active, which means that the web page which is related to is still being rendered in the browser.

- Local: The may exists inside a function or a block of code such as a for loop for example, or some other specific scope. 

JavaScript allows variables to be used withouth being declared first. Undeclared variables end up having a global scope. To enable re-use of variable names in local scopes, they should be declared first. There are specific keyword which can be used to declare and define the scope and behaviour of variables.

### JavaScript properties

- Weakly and dynamically typed

- Very permissive when compared to Java, C++, etc. 

- There are many implicit type conversions that may lead to unpredictable results.

- Enabling "strict" mode could restrict the throwing of unexpected errors: 

    - It prevents the use of undeclared variables.

    - Does not permit the use of reserved keywords as variables or function names.

    - It prevents coding practices that get in the way of optimizations performed by JavaScript engines. 

    - It throws errors instead of failing silently when unsafe operations are performed.
